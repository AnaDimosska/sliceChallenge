# Pizzabot

The purpose of the Pizza project is to deliver pizzas to predetermined locations.

### Motivation

The motive behind this project lies on latest cutting-edge pizza technology research  and curiosity as to how robots would manage to perform human duties

### Setup

Any machine that have installed Python 3.5 or later to run it. To start the program open the 'main.py' directory and enter valid matrix and pizza-drop points.

##  How to use?

To try and launch this project, from keyboard input  enter a valid matrix and a list of locations where the pizza should be delivered. Example: 5x5 (1,3) (4,4) . At the exit you should get a
list of steps on how best to get to the locations one by one.
## Tests

The tests are checking the project functions and whether we have covered all possible cases where the program may return wrong result. Open the tests.py file and you see 3
different classes Manhattan class, SplitValuesMatrix and SplitValuesPoints where you can test the function for any input you want.
